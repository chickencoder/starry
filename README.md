# Starry ✨

_Work in Progress_ &mdash; Fun little Static React Sites

### Features

- 📁 Simple file based routing
- 💥 Powerful built-in data layer
- ☂️ Opt-in hydration (just pure, semantic HTML!)
- 🔌 Easy to plugin
- 🍓 JAMStack FTW!

### Reason

There are already some excellent solutions in the React static-site arena, namely [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) &amp; [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby). Next.js allows developers to develop websites and apps through a set of cleverly thought out conventions, such as file-system routing. However, Next.js is certainly not a batteries-included kind of framework.

Even for the most basic use cases like a blog, Next.js requires the developer to implement boilerplate code for loading in their content and data. On the other hand, Gatsby has very powerful tooling allowing developers to include almost _any_ kind of data or content in their site almost immediately.

Starry aims to strike a balance between power &amp; simplicity. Starry is also heavily influenced by [11ty](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/).
