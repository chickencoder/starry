# Starry ✨

> _Work in Progress_

Starry is a fun way of building **JAMStack** projects. Enjoy building static React sites with a powerful data layer, an easy-to-plugin generator &amp; opt-in client side hydration. Serve your sites from anywhere!

### What can I make?

Here's some ideas of things you could make...

- 📝 Blog
- 🎙 Podcast
- 📗 Book
- 🌉 Photo Gallery
- 🏖 Holiday Scrapbook
- 🛍 Shop
- 🥽 Wiki

### Reason

There are already some excellent solutions in the React static-site arena, namely [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) &amp; [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby). Next.js allows developers to develop websites and apps through a set of cleverly thought out conventions, such as file-system routing. However, Next.js is certainly not a batteries-included kind of framework.

Even for the most basic use cases like a blog, Next.js requires the developer to implement boilerplate code for loading in their content and data. On the other hand, Gatsby has very powerful tooling allowing developers to include almost _any_ kind of data or content in their site almost immediately.

Starry aims to strike a balance between power &amp; simplicity. Starry is also heavily influenced by [11ty](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/).
